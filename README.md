# Text4U

## What is Text4U?

Text4U is an app with the goal of using Artifical Intelligence to assist everyday conversations. We combine your everyday messaging needs with cutting edge AI language processing. This exciting new project is built using Flutter for the front end interface, and running Flask for the GPT-3 API. Text4U will learn from your previous text messages to generate hyperealistic responses that minimize the amount of time you need to spend worrying over you text conversations. 

## Why Text4U?

Responding to a large amount of texts each day can become an arduous task. This often results in late responses, or even unanswered messages. Text4U will be a mobile application designed to automate the process of responding to text messages. It will use artificial intelligence trained on a particular individual’s text data. Users will be able to turn this application on or off, and also reject/edit messages that are AI-generated before sending. Each person’s AI-generated messages will be specific to their personality, thus sounding just like them. While this application is not designed to be a replacement for a person, it will make the process of responding much more efficient. Maintaining personal and professional relationships with Text4U could not be easier. 

## Development Setup

We recommend using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to run device emulators for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). 
Detailed installation instructions can be found here:

> <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>

The backend uses [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) to run, which needs to be created and used in the same directory of the project. Installation instructions can be found here:
