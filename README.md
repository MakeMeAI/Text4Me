# Text4U

### Project Description

Responding to a large amount of texts each day can become an arduous task. This often results in late responses, or even unanswered messages. Text4Me will be a mobile application designed to automate the process of responding to text messages. It will use artificial intelligence trained on a particular individual’s text data. Users will be able to turn this application on or off, and also reject/edit messages that are AI-generated before sending. Each person’s AI-generated messages will be specific to their personality, thus sounding just like them. While this application is not designed to be a replacement for a person, it will make the process of responding much more efficient. Maintaining personal and professional relationships with Text4Me could not be easier.
